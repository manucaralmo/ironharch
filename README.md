IronHarch is a recreation of the famous Archero game, made entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the IronHack Module 1 project. 

The game consists of different waves that you must overcome by facing different enemies and final monsters.
Shoot the enemies only when you are standing still and kill them all to win the game.  

If you like the game, I invite you to leave me a Star in my Project.

## How to play?
At the moment, the game is only compatible with computers or devices with a keyboard.  
You can play by accessing this link directly from your computer.
